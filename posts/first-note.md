My name is Arvin, and I hail from Kashmir - a place where beauty and harsh realities coexist. Growing up surrounded by the region's unyielding challenges has indelibly shaped my outlook on life and instilled in me a relentless curiosity about the world.

I’m currently working as a Machine Learning Engineer, tackling the fascinating challenges like languages analysis and distributed learning. Every day, my work fuels my passion for deep learning and the mysteries of consciousness, topics that leave my mind buzzing with questions and ideas.

Beyond the technical realm, I have many hobbies that keep me grounded and inspired. I delight in programming, devour science fiction novels, and explore the depths of philosophy. When I’m not immersed in code or deep thought, you might find me gaming, world-building, or writing. Each endeavor serving as a channel for the countless thoughts swirling in my head.

This blog is my personal space: a place where I can document and share everything from intricate technical details to reflective musings. I hope that by staying consistent in documenting both the technical and the thoughtful, I can create a tapestry of my experiences that resonates on many levels.
