A while back, while working on a computer vision problem, I was building a mesh stitching pipeline using OpenCV and Open3D to align point clouds and reconstruct surface geo from a 3dMD capture setup. I kept running into subtle but persistent dependency issues, Open3D required a specific version of NumPy and Python that clashed with the OpenCV build I was using, and even minor upgrades would break bindings or introduce runtime errors. Managing these conflicts across virtual environments became a constant friction point that slowed down experimentation and made the pipeline fragile.

Switching to <code>uv</code> for Python package management felt like a breath of fresh air: fast installs, clean environments, and reproducible builds. I don’t need to tell a savvy, up-to-date audience how uv outperforms tools like Conda, pip, or Poetry in speed and determinism. What I do want to explore in this post is what lies beneath that performance. Because under the hood, the problem uv is solving, **dependency resolution** is, in theory, NP-complete. And yet, it somehow makes that complexity feel invisible.

This isn't just academic trivia. It explains why package managers sometimes struggle, why lockfiles matter, and why tools like uv are engineered the way they are.

But what makes dependency resolution hard? At its core, dependency resolution is a constraint satisfaction problem. You want to install a set of packages such that

1. All version constraints are satisfied
2. All transitive dependencies are compatible
3. No conflicts exist between packages

This sounds simple until you realize that dependencies can depend on other dependencies, sometimes conditionally, and often with overlapping or conflicting version requirements. The result is a recursive graph traversal problem with branching choices and constraints, exactly the kind of problem that grows exponentially with size.

Enter SAT: The Keystone of NP-Completeness. The Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT) asks - given a logical expression, can you assign truth values to variables to make the whole thing true? In 1971, Stephen Cook proved SAT was the first NP-complete problem, laying the foundation for computational complexity theory. What does NP-complete mean? Two things:

1. Any problem in NP can be reduced to SAT
2. SAT is both verifiable in polynomial time and as hard as any problem in NP

In other words, if you can solve SAT efficiently, you can solve *every* problem in NP efficiently. Dependency resolution can be reduced to SAT. For example, if package A requires B < 2.0 and C requires B >= 2.0, you're essentially solving a logical formula with constraints. The resolution engine must explore combinations to find a valid assignment, or prove none exists.

To quickly clarify NP-complete vs NP-hrad, NP-complete problems are the hardest problems *within* NP: they are verifiable in polynomial time, but not known to be solvable in polynomial time. NP-hard problems may be even harder, they aren't necessarily verifiable in polynomial time and may include undecidable problems.

Dependency resolution, as implemented by uv and other package managers, falls into the NP-complete category. It's verifiable (you can check if a solution works), but solving it efficiently for all cases is not guaranteed.

What makes uv special isn't that it avoids NP-completeness (it doesn't). Instead, it sidesteps the worst-case behavior by

- Using Rust for fast graph traversal and constraint checking
- Treating lockfiles as a source of truth, not a suggestion
- Avoiding exhaustive search in favor of smart heuristics and deterministic installs

In practice, uv solves most real-world dependency graphs quickly and reliably. But the theoretical complexity remains, and that's why even the best package managers can hit edge cases that feel like "dependency hell."

Understanding the NP-complete nature of dependency resolution gives you insight into why package managers behave the way they do and why tools like uv are designed with performance and determinism in mind. It's not just about installing packages faster; it's about solving a deep computational problem efficiently enough to keep workflows smooth.

If you're building reproducible environments, benchmarking pipelines, or just want fewer surprises in your installs, uv is worth the switch. And now you know: behind its speed lies a problem that’s been challenging computer scientists for decades.
